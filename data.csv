"Question: What is abstraction in Java? Answer: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, usually achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.",
Question: What is an abstract class in Java? Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementations) that must be implemented by subclasses.,
Question: What is an interface in Java? Answer: An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain only abstract methods and constants. It is used to specify a contract that implementing classes must follow.,
"Question: How does method overriding work in Java? Answer: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to alter or extend the behavior of the superclass method.",
"Question: What is the super keyword used for in Java? Answer: The super keyword refers to the superclass of the current object and is used to access superclass methods, constructors, and fields from within the subclass.",
"Question: What is the this keyword used for in Java? Answer: The this keyword refers to the current instance of a class and is used to access instance variables, methods, and constructors from within the class.",
"Question: What is the difference between composition and inheritance in Java? Answer: Composition involves building a class using one or more objects of other classes (has-a relationship), while inheritance involves extending a class to create a new class (is-a relationship).",
Question: What is method hiding in Java? Answer: Method hiding occurs when a static method in a subclass has the same name and parameters as a static method in the superclass. The subclass method hides the superclass method rather than overriding it.,
"Question: What is the purpose of the final keyword in OOP? Answer: In OOP, the final keyword is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes, providing a way to create immutable or fixed behavior.",
"Question: What is the instanceof operator used for in Java? Answer: The instanceof operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass, or if it implements a particular interface.",
"Question: How does dynamic method dispatch work in Java? Answer: Dynamic method dispatch is a mechanism in Java where a method call is resolved at runtime based on the object's runtime type, allowing method overriding and polymorphism.",
"Question: What is a concrete class in Java? Answer: A concrete class is a class that can be instantiated and provides implementations for all its methods, unlike an abstract class that may have abstract methods.",
"Question: What is a default method in an interface? Answer: A default method in an interface is a method with a default implementation, introduced in Java 8, allowing interfaces to have methods with a body.",
"Question: What is the purpose of the abstract keyword in Java? Answer: The abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes and methods, indicating that the class cannot be instantiated and that the method must be implemented by subclasses.",
"Question: What is the difference between overloading and overriding in Java? Answer: Overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class, while overriding refers to providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in the superclass.",
"Question: What is the significance of the Object class in Java? Answer: The Object class is the root of the class hierarchy in Java. Every class implicitly inherits from Object and inherits methods such as equals(), hashCode(), and toString().",
"Question: What is the default keyword used for in Java interfaces? Answer: The default keyword is used to provide a default implementation for methods in an interface, allowing interface evolution without affecting existing implementations.",
"Question: Can you instantiate an abstract class in Java? Answer: No, you cannot instantiate an abstract class directly. You must create a subclass that implements all abstract methods of the abstract class and then instantiate the subclass.",
"Question: What happens if you call an abstract method from a constructor of an abstract class? Answer: Calling an abstract method from a constructor of an abstract class will not compile if the subclass has not implemented the abstract method, as the abstract method must be implemented before creating an instance.",
"Question: Can a class extend multiple classes in Java? Answer: No, Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. A class can only extend one class but can implement multiple interfaces.",
"Question: Can a static method be overridden in Java? Answer: No, static methods cannot be overridden. They can be hidden if a subclass defines a static method with the same name and parameters as the superclass method.",
"Question: What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding with examples? Answer: Method overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class, while method overriding is providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in the superclass.",
"Question: Can you override a private method in Java? Answer: No, private methods cannot be overridden because they are not visible to subclasses. They can only be redefined within the same class.",
"Question: What is the difference between == and .equals() when comparing objects in Java? Answer: == compares object references to see if they point to the same memory location, while .equals() compares the actual content of the objects if overridden appropriately.",
